Imagine having a magical tool that could effortlessly predict restaurant ratings: You just provide some information, it returns an (almost) accurate rating in no time! Well, that is exactly what Machine Learning can do!


### In this project, I developed a predictive model to estimate restaurant ratings based on various features.

- Dimension: 9551 rows × 21 columns
The dataset consists of multiple features, including: restaurant_name, cuisines, restaurant_type, city, aggregate_rating, votes, cost_for_two, currency, e.t.c.



#### Key Findings & Surprising Insights

- Highly-rated restaurants tend to have online delivery & table booking options.
- Votes and Average Cost significantly impact ratings - higher customer engagement often correlates with better ratings.
- Cuisine Type & Location play a critical role in predicting ratings, with some cuisines receiving consistently higher ratings.

#### Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrated how machine learning can be used to predict restaurant ratings based on key influencing factors. With the Gradient Boosting Regressor, I achieved an exceptionally high R² score (0.9952), indicating strong predictive power.
